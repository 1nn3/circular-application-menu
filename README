Fork of Circular-Application-Menu by Steffen Rumberger

A Circular-Application-Menu (C-A-M) mirroring the same structure as the existing application menu for the GNOME desktop.

It was originally just a paper prototype written by Cole Anstey. But his project is no longer maintained and no further contributions will be accepted by him. That's why i maintain a fork.
